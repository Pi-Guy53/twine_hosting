            NTRDs or Networked Tactical Response Drones are automated drones that can provide security without the need
            for human intervention. They are cheap, take up little space, and are extremely modular.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are 4 main types of NTRDs, Scout, Combat, Sniper, and Heavy, each with their own uses and equipment.
            These 4 main types are further supported by the much larger Assault Drones, which while rarely deployed,
            offer additional fire support capabilities.
            <br>
            <br>
            Combat, Sniper, and Heavy NTRDs use the same base chassis, but equip different weapons and targeting
            systems.
            <br>
            Combat NTRDs are equipped with twin gatling cannons that can fire either less-lethal or AP rounds.
            <br>
            Sniper NTRDs are equipped with twin railguns, and long range sensors. These do no have a less-lethal option.
            <br>
            Heavy NTRDs are equipped with twin rocket pods, and indirect fire sensors. These rocket pods can be loaded
            with a variety of munitions including, but not limited to, HE, Smoke, BeanBags, or Nets.
            <br>
            Scout NTRDs, also called Patrol drones, have a much smaller chassis, allowing them to go undetected easier.
            They are equipped with an EDC less-lethal launcher.
            <br>
            Assault NTRDs have a significantly larger chassis than any other NTRD. Sporting multiple rocket pods,
            railguns, and gatling cannons, Assault NTRDs are designed for combat, not security, and the deployment of
            even one is a rare. That said, the additional fire support offered by these larger NTRDs is often what it
            takes to deter raiders.
            <br>
            <br>
            NTRDs is the blank term for these support drones, and different manufactures will have offer differing
            specs.
            <br>
            The NTRDs referenced here are from the Blake Security Inc (BSI) line of security drones, and include
            integrated support with their patented, Tactical sYstem Response and Attack NeTwork AI system which is
            designed to coordinate NTRDs efficiently and effectively
            <br>
            <br>
            Some express distrust of NTRDs and their handler AIs stating that an AI cannot be trusted in such a high
            risk area, and resent the use of lethals onboard completely automated platforms.
