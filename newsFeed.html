            A rebel cell calling themselves The Liberators, lead by form ASR Officer Vearin Terrill, took over the
            city claiming that the government is
            using the recent attacks as a coverup to increase its military presence, and enact more restrictions.
            <br>
            <br>
            These "Liberators" used the militaries own state of the art defensive seawall, and barricades to entrap
            local law
            enforcement, and to counter the military counter strike. The automated seawall defenses alone shot down
            over 15 aircraft promting a ground assault.
            <br>
            <br>
            The ground forces fared little better, as the automatic defense systems had been re-programmed to ignore
            standard IFF frequencies.
            <br>
            However, there were only 3 reported casualties, a single Law Enforcment Officer, and 2
            ground troopers who were caught in a tunnel collapse caused by UNE forces. All pilots ejected safely,
            despite the seawall being initially programmed to shootdown parachutes. There must have been an error in the
            system.
            <br>
            <br>
            The "Liberators" later relinquished control of Tenebrous City stating quote "If it was this easy for
            <strong>us</strong> a small group with little supplies or training, to take over a major city, how easy
            would it be for another nation.
            <br>
            With how readily these 'state of the art' defenses could hold its own city hostage, are they really for
            defense, or control?"
            <br>
            <br>
            Since then, the entierty of The "Liberators" have fled the UNE for JSC space.
            <br>
            Anyone with information on their whereabouts, especially information on their leader "Vearin Terrill"
            is urged to contact the UNE hotline at <span class="redacted">76871153</span> immediately.
