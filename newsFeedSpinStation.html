            Spin Stations, so called for their centrifuge based gravity, are a common sight orbiting planets, moons and
            large asteroids, and are home to many spacefarers.
            <br>
            <br>
            Spin Stations, often confused with High Ports, the primary difference being High ports are located
            <strong>on</strong> a planetoid/asteroid, and Spin Stations being in orbit.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are many things to do aboard Spin Stations, as they are designed to be a permanent home to Spacefarers
            and their families. They contain schools, shopping centers, recreational areas, sports fields, and even vast
            hydroponic farms.
            <br>
            In addition, Spin Stations house markets, economic facilities, and are thus the economic centers for their
            sector of space.
            <br>
            <br>
            While Spin Stations are always inside of either UNE, JSC, or PNPC space, they tend to operate under their
            own
            jurisdiction. Those on the outer edges of space are allowed significantly more freedoms in their operations,
            and while some of these Spin Stations are described as lawless, the majority keep their own order. Either
            with Private Military Contractors (PMCs), or Private Enforcers (PE).
            <br>
            Only in the cases of massive unrest, or prevailing problems do the JSC or PNPC need to intervene, while the
            UNE is constantly micromanaging their own Spin Stations.
            <br>
            <br>
            In short, Spin Stations keep their own little worlds spinning.
