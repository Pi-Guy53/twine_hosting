            The Torus sector, the donut of the solar system. The Torus sector, so named for its donut shape, is also
            known as the asteroid belt, and is what separates the inner and outer planets in our solar system.
            <br>
            <br>
            Due to its location, both the UNE and JSC have attempted to lay claim to this strategic area, and its
            abundance of resource rich asteroids. This has resulted in the Torus sector becoming something of a
            "neutral" no-mans-land between controlled space.
            <br>
            <br>
            Without any government officially being able to claim this sector, raiders and pirates have flourished.
            Drawn in by the multitude of mining ships harvesting these valuable resources, and the lack of law
            enforcement.
            <br>
            Due to this, many mining companies have started hiring PMC personnel to protect their rigs, crew, and most
            importantly cargo.
            <br>
            <br>
            While this strategic sector is officially neutral, both JSC and UNE will lay temporary claim to whichever
            portion of the Torus sector that is closest to their home planet (Earth or Jupiter) at any given point.
            Though it is still very rare to see any military ships deep in this sector at any given point.
            <br>
            <br>
            In typical UNE fashion, they claim the Torus sector should belong to them being it is physically closer to
            Earth/Mars, and that Jupiter has its own "Trojan" asteroid fields.
            <br>
            The JSC however, is always ready to fight for their independence, and that includes defending the neutrality
            of the Torus Sector. The JSC believe the Torus sector has its own right to remain independent.
